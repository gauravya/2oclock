        <p> Dear Robert,</p>
        <p>
            Hope you're well. I have some bad news. SB-1047 is dead.

            A friend shared a thought with me while we were driving.
            "Parenting is a strange test of integrity," he said.
            Breaking rules in front of your child is hypocritical.
            You tell them, "Wait for the crossing signal to turn green."
            Adults can get away with jaywalking; a child can't.
            They'd probably get hurt or worse.
            So you wait with your child, obedient to the signal, while others stream past.
            Your child watches, puzzled.            
        </p>

            I've spent many hours of my university life confronting the word, 'law,' Robert.
            Its implications, its multifaceted nature, its power to evoke fear.
            The law is very much alive.
            It lurks in the back of your mind, dances at lawyers' fingertips, and perches on parliamentarians' tongues.
            It permeates everything with few questioning its merit or mechanics.
        </p>

        <p>
            Perhaps it's because the law is seen as a mystical realm.
            A subject matter left for the articulate and educated.
            Questioning the law is for lawyers.
        </p>

        <h2>The death of SB-1047</h2>
        
        <p>
            Have you ever tried reading a piece of law from back to front, Rob?
            It's horribly tiring.
            Drafters aren't trying as hard as other writers to keep people's attention.
            They don't fluctuate their words.
            They don't vary sentence lengths.
            Law isn't poetry.
            The law does not evoke strong emotion.
            It doesn't leave you in tears.
            It only leaves you feeling a tad bit bored.
            So I feel quite strange, mourning the death of a recent legislative effort.

            Gov. Newsom vetoed SB-1047.
            The Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act.
            I've had strong opinions on this bill.
            You can find them in <a href="">video format</a>, Rob.
            I hope I also have your subscription.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two clear sides.
            The tech industry doesn't want regulation on technology that could make them billions.
            The worriers (or derogatorily called 'doomers') think AI will end humanity.
            My video makes it clear which side I'm on.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Bill was vetoed for all the wrong reasons.
            The tech industry contested SB-1047 to "stand up for the little guy."
            They argued it would stifle innovation and halt American progress on AI.
            Gov. Newsom, in vetoing the Bill, <a>said</a>:
            <blockquote>
                    By focusing only on the most expensive and large-scale models, SB 1047
                    establishes a regulatory framework that could give the public a false sense of
                    security about controlling this fast-moving technology. Smaller, specialized
                    models may emerge as equally or even more dangerous than the models
                    targeted by SB 1047 - at the potential expense of curtailing the very innovation
                    that fuels advancement in favor of the public good.
            </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
            Oh dear. What do you make of that Rob?
        </p>

        <p>
            Is it possible for two things to be true?
            Can you regulate both large and small models?
            Yes, yes you can.
            Why veto a Bill that primarily does the former?
            Clearly, multiple laws can tackle different risks from the same technology.
            On the very day SB-1047 was vetoed, Gov. Newsom signed a dozen different regulatory interventions.
            One requires health care providers to disclose the use of GenAI.
            Another criminalises distributing (aritifically generated) sexually explicit images of identifiable persons.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Gov. Newsom wants policies 'rooted in science and fact' he says.
            Here are some facts. 
            Larger the model, the more dangerous it will be.
            Smaller models are far less capable at performing agentic and dangerous capabilities.
            Here is the science. 
        </p>

        <p>
            If you think you should regulate smaller models, how does this not thwart innovation even more?
            Gov. wants to tackle known risks, risks we can see happen.
            Not risks that are merely speculation, like AI causing the heat death of the universe.
            Perhaps we haven't seen AI systems cause large-scale infrastructural damage.
            Or kill human beings.
            Perhaps because if it did, we would not be here.
            But why do anything about it now?
            Why not wait for it to unfold right in front of your eyes?
        </p>

        <p>
            Tort law is somewhat like this.
            Reactive.
            A tortious damage is a civil liability.
            It's where one can be compensated for harm caused to them.
            Car accidents, dangerous work environments, that sort of thing.
            Tort law feels premised on accidents happening.
            Then going "Woops, well new law now!"
        </p>

        <p>
            <blockquote>
                Given the stakes - protecting against actual
                threats without unnecessarily thwarting the promise of this technology to
                advance the public good - we must get this right.
            </blockquote>
        </p>

        <h2>Getting it right</h2>

        <p>
            So what should happen next?
            Maybe it is here I concede Rob that whatever I say next is speculation.
            I dislike people who complain whilst having no opinion on what they think should happen next.
        </p>

        <p>Gov. Newsom's approach is to tackle use-based </p>
